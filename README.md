# DesignProject1 Whitney

Project done as final part of Senior year education at Johnson and Wales University. The product is a small game designed for young students to learn ASL by providing a score based game that allows them to sign the shown letter to their camera for points. Originally a SQL Server was paid for that kept high scores, but this feature no longer works as the server is no longer paid for.

To run this program, simply download the repository and run the GUI program.
